            I graduated with a degree in Aeronautical Engineering from the
            Turkish Air Force Academy , had worked for several years as a
            project officer at Turkish Air Force and received 8+ certificates of
            excellence from the top commanders of the Turkish Air Force before
            making the switch to software dev. <br /> <br />
